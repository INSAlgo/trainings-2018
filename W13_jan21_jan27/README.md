The problem that laid the foundations of graph theory. We will solve it interactively on the board. ([more info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Bridges_of_K%C3%B6nigsberg))


## Codingame: Teads' sponsored contest

This problem is not easy if you just started with graph theory, but doesn't require the knowledge of any special algorithm. I will be happy to help you iterate until you find a solution, so don't be shy and ask for help, don't get stuck. A O(n) solution is expected.
