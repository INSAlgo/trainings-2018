Special course today!
===
Today we try getting a sense of what machine learning is with a little introduction ! 
Before opening the notebook in this weeks' file, complete the following setup : 
##Get anaconda
It enables you to create virtual environments, which we will need
##Create a new virtual environment with python 3.6
Tensorflow won't run on python 3.7 for now
##Get the following modules on that environnement: 
-tensorflow
-numpy
-sklearn
-matplotlib

You're good to go !

Once again, thanks to Thibault Douzon for providing us the material for this course.
