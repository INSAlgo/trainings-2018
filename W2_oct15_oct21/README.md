# Problems of the week

If you managed to submit a correct solution to last week's problems 2 and 3, but got stuck somewhere between problems 4 and 5, we recommend that you join group 1.

However, if you felt uncomfortable with the Python programming language or had trouble with problems 2 and 3, you may consider joining group 2.

About problem 1 : There were several ways to get a correct solution for last week's problem 1 but some of them didn't get accepted by LeetCode in Python, due to performance issues, so don't feel bad if you didn't solve problem 1.


In any case, you can look at today's agenda for both groups and choose the one you feel the most interested in :)

## Group 1 (Intermediate to Advanced Programmer) - Review of Week 1 Problems

### Agenda

We will review the last two or three problems of Week 1. We will look at the solutions and give some explanations.
In the meantime, we will also work on the tasks you didn't have time to complete last week.

If you completed every task last week, take a look at Week 0 problems. If you have already completed them too, we have some more for you just below :

### Additionnal Problems

#### Intermediate problem (1) :
https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-characters-by-frequency/

#### Intermediate problem (2) :
https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-square/

#### Hard problem :
https://leetcode.com/problems/wiggle-subsequence/

## Group 2 (Python Beginner) - Handling Input/Output in Python 3

### Agenda

Last week, we didn't need to handle inputs and outputs in our programs, because LeetCode did it for us.

Handling inputs and outputs are always the first and the last steps your program performs when solving a problem, that's why it is extremely important to know how to do it properly.
Even if you have written the right algorithm to solve the problem, your solution can fail if you neglected your I/O code.

Today, we will see how to handle properly inputs and outputs in Python 3 :

* How to fetch data from the standard input stream (single line inputs, multi line inputs, single values, arrays, formatted inputs...) ;

* How to format and send data to the standard output stream ;

* How to use input and output redirection in a Linux environment to easily test your programs.
