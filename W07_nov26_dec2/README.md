Problems of the week
===

The topic today is the *Divide & Conquer* strategy. It is a very important topic and multiple further trainings will be about specific parts of this paradigm.

Some of the exercises here were already listed in previous trainings but very few of you had time to complete them, and we were missing the theory.

## Problem 1 (\*) :

With binary search: https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-perfect-square/

## Problem 2 (\*\*) :

Exercise: implement a merge sort
1. Recursive version, top-down (a bit easier)
2. Iterative version, bottom-up (can sort in-place)

*Top-down:* split in two until the size of the sub-lists is one
*Bottom-up:* construct runs of size 1, 2, 4, ..., n

## Problem 3 (\*\*\*) :

2D binary search: https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/shadows-of-the-knight-episode-1

## Problem 4 (\*\*\*\*):

I guess you understood the concept, now let's see with a harder problem: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/fair-cut/problem
