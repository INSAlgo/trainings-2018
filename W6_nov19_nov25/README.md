Problems of the week
===

Today you won't learn elegance and efficient algorithms: we will learn the notions of brute force search and backtracking. Don't lose your time finding efficient solutions, the goal is to find quickly naive algorithms.

The problem of N queens (that you might have tried in week 0) is a generalization of the problem on a normal chess board and it is a well-known backtracking problem.
