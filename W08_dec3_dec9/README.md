Problems of the week
===

Today we continue with exercises about the theme \*Divide and Conquer\*. We would like to allow you to terminate some exercises from last week if you didn't have time to solve them, and we add some new exercises.

## Problem 1 (\*\*\*)

The problem 3 from last week, that most people didn't have time to solve. It is a 2D binary search, the exercise is very interesting so try to solve it, whatever your level is, and ask for help if necessary.

## Problem 2 (\*\*\*)

Solve it with a top-down recursive approach. Don't forget to memoize the results so you don't compute the same thing twice.
