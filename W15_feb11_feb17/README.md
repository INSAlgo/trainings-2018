## 2: Dijkstra: Shortest Reach 2, HackerRank (\*\*\*)

*Note: the test case 7 is tricky, you might need to modify the input code in Python, or run it with Pypy 3 instead of Python 3 (CPython)*

## 3: Roads and Libraries, HackerRank (\*\*\*)

For this one, you can use multiple BFS/DFS, but I prefer by far the solution with a Union-Find data structure.
